	{\bf Theorem : }$V = W_1 \oplus W_2 \iff V = W_1 + W_2$ and $W_1 \cap W_2 = \{0\}$  \\
	
	{\bf Proof($ \implies $)} :
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Suppose $V = W_1 \oplus W_2$
		\item $V = W_1 \oplus W_2 \implies V = W_1 + W_2$
		\item To prove : $W_1 \cap W_2 = \{0\}$ 
		\item Let $z = W_1 \cap W_2$ where $z \neq 0$
		\item Then : $z = {\color{green}\mathbf{0}} + {\color{blue} z} = {\color{green}z} + {\color{blue}\mathbf{0}}$ where blue elements belong to $W_1$ and green elements belong to $W_2$
		\item As z has been expressed in two ways, therefore the representation is not unique.
		\item Therefore z has to be $\mathbf{0}$. Hence proved.
	\end{itemize}

	{\bf Proof($\impliedby$)}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Suppose $V = W_1 + W_2$ and $W_1 \cap W_2 = \{0\}$ 
		\item To Prove : $V = W_1 \oplus W_2$
		\item let $z \in V$. 
		\item Let blue represent the fact that the element belongs to $W_1$ and green elements belong to $W_2$
		\item Suppose the following two representations of z exist:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $z = {\color{blue}x_1 + \color{green}y_1}$ 
			\item $z = {\color{blue}x_2 + \color{green}y_2}$
		\end{itemize}
		\item Then $x_1 + y_1 = x_2 + y_2 = z$
		\item ${\color{blue}x_1 - x_2} = {\color{green}y_1 - y_2}$
		\item Clearly LHS = RHS
		\item But as ${\color{blue}W_1} \cap {\color{green}W_2} = \{0\}$
		\item Therefore, $x_1 - x_2 = 0$ and $y_1 - y_2 = 0$
		\item Therefore $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 = y_2$
		\item Therefore each $z \in V$ is uniquely represented as ${\color{blue}x} + {\color{green}y}$
		\item Therefore $V = W_1 \oplus W_2$
	\end{itemize}
